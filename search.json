    "section": "",
    "text": "In September of 2022, Major League Baseball announced three new rule changes, one being a pitch clock. They tried this demo to create a quicker paced game.\nThis rule stipulates that a 30-second timer between batters will be implemented in the 2023 season. Then between pitches, a 15-second timer will be in place with empty bases and a 20-second timer when there are runners on base. Time can only be added to a game if the umpire provides it under certain circumstances.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(baseballr)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ngames22 <- read_csv(\"gamepacks22.csv\")\n\ngames23 <- read_csv(\"gamepacks23.csv\")\n\nstats <- read_csv(\"baseballstats.csv\")\n\nPace <- read_csv(\"Pace22:23.csv\") %>% remove_empty(which=c(\"rows\", \"cols\"))\n\nCOL <- Pace %>% filter(Team == \"COL\")\nCHW <- Pace %>% filter(Team == \"CHW\")\nCIN <- Pace %>% filter(Team == \"CIN\")\nOAK <- Pace %>% filter(Team == \"OAK\")\n\nPaceTeams <- bind_rows(COL, CHW, CIN, OAK)\n\ntime22 <- games22 %>% \n  separate(elapsed_time, into=c(\"hours\", \"minutes\"), sep=\":\", extra=\"merge\") %>%\n  mutate(total_time = as.numeric(hours) + (as.numeric(minutes)/60)) %>%\n  select(game_date,total_time,venue_name) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\ntime23 <- games23 %>% \n  separate(elapsed_time, into=c(\"hours\", \"minutes\"), sep=\":\", extra=\"merge\") %>%\n  mutate(total_time = as.numeric(hours) + (as.numeric(minutes)/60)) %>%\n  select(game_date,total_time,venue_name) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\ntotal_hours23 <- time23 %>%\n  group_by(game_date) %>%\n  summarize(\n    average_time = mean(total_time)\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(game_number = row_number())\n\ntotal_hours22 <- time22 %>%\n  group_by(game_date) %>%\n  summarize(\n    average_time = mean(total_time)\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(game_number = row_number()) %>% \n  filter( game_number < 23 )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=total_hours23, aes(x=game_number, y=average_time), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_line(data=total_hours22, aes(x=game_number, y=average_time), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Number of Games\", \n    y=\"Average Length of Game\", \n    title=\"MLB Season 23 Sees Slight Decrease in Average Game Time Compared to Season 22\", \n    subtitle=\"Data shows<span style = 'color:blue ;'> season 2023</span> a significant decrease in average game length compared\\\nto last season, leading to a more exciting and dynamic on-field product.\", \n    caption=\"Source: BaseballR | By Savanna Hebbert\"\n    )  +\ntheme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(stats, aes(x=Team)) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y=PPTV, fill=\"PPTV\"), stat=\"identity\", width=0.5) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y=-BPTV, fill=\"BPTV\"),  stat=\"identity\",width=0.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Amount of Added Time\", \n    title=\"Pitch Timer Violations Compared Between Pitchers and Batters by Team\", \n    subtitle=\"Analyzed timer violation data for pitchers and batters across different teams to see which teams had the most violations.\", \n    caption=\"Source: BaseballR | By Savanna Hebbert\"\n    )  +\n  scale_fill_manual(name=\"\", values=c(\"PPTV\"=\"blue\", \"BPTV\"=\"red\")) +\ntheme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis clock has not been loved by all, Braves were tied in the bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, and a 3-2 count. Cal Conley (Braves infielder) found himself in a situation where he could save the day but sadly was not the hero. Conley was not in the box with the pitch clock hit the eight second mark, receiving an automatic third strike. And the Braves moved into extra innings after a very anticlimactic 6-6 tie in the ninth. While most pitchers have yet to violate the timer as often, there has been a noticeable disruption in their pace. The statement stands true as the slowest pace between pitches in the ’23 season is 19.2 seconds from the Oakland Athletics, topping the fastest pace in the ’22 season from the Rockies at 22 seconds.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=Pace, aes(x=Season, y=Pace, group=Team), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=Pace, aes(x=Season, y=Pace), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=COL, aes(x=Season, y=Pace), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_line(data=COL, aes(x=Season, y=Pace, group=Team), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data=CHW, aes(x=Season, y=Pace), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_line(data=CHW, aes(x=Season, y=Pace, group=Team), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=CIN, aes(x=Season, y=Pace), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data=CIN, aes(x=Season, y=Pace, group=Team), color=\"red\") +    geom_point(data=OAK, aes(x=Season, y=Pace), color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_line(data=OAK, aes(x=Season, y=Pace, group=Team), color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2021.8, 2023.2), breaks=c(2022, 2023)) + \n  geom_text(data=PaceTeams %>% filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .075, y=Pace, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data=PaceTeams %>% filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .075, y=Pace, label=Team)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Seconds Between Pitch\", \n    title=\"Comparing Pitch Pace in the Era of the Pitch Clock\", \n    subtitle=\"Pace is a measure of the seconds between pitches for both hitters and pitchers.\\\nPicked the teams with the slowest and fastest pitch pace from each season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: FanGraphs | By Savanna Hebbert\"\n    )  +\ntheme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this is the first season these rules have been in place, even after the time violations and the added disengagement time the games are significantly shorter. Since 2022 the pitch clock has shortened an MLB game by 25 minutes, which is huge. The average duration of a game in the 2023 season thus far is a little under three hours.\nYou can sit through an intriguing three-hour long movie or a thrilling four-hour long movie, but the time wasted makes the experience a little less riveting. Same for baseball, it is not about getting everyone in and out as fast as they can, it is about making the most of everyone’s experience and time while at the stadium."
